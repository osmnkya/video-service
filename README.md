# A simple Video Service

Our video clients need a video service to interact with for dealing with video metadata and such.

Initially the service has methods for:

- Creating a video
- Getting a video

# Executing the test suite

- Run `mvn test` or load this project into your favourite IDE and run the tests from there.
